## Reviews:
- Clarity: The plot is easily to read and understand its meanings.
- Esthetic:
  - The colors: Maybe you would like to reverse the colors used to stand for the number of locations providing flu vaccinations. It is because more people will tend to regard darker color stands for bigger numbers.
  - The legend explaining the color use is helpful.
- Honesty: The plot honestly reproducing the data.
