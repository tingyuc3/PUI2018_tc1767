## Clarity:
The plot is easy to read and clear. I can tell which locations have more or less flu injection station easily. But at first I am confused by the magnitude of the numbers before I know it's about flu vaccine locations.  

## Esthetic:
It's a pretty plot! I like the color that you choose. But in this plot, color is darker when there is less vaccine locations. So I mistaked it at first glimpse. Becaue I usually assumed that darker color stands for higer density. 

## Honesty:
The plot honestly reproduced the data.
