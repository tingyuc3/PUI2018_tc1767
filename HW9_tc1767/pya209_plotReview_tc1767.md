## Clarity

The plot is clear and easy to read. Pranay has plotted the stock price of Apple from 2006 to 2016 and it has been visualized explicitly.

## Esthetic

The plot has reached the standard for aesthetics. It uses appropriate color to plot the trend of Apple's stock price. The scale and label of x and y are used appropriately. Since the time period of this plot is 2006 to 2016, it might be better to rearrange the scale of the x-axis. Another small suggestion is to refine the wording of the title as well as y label.

## Honesty

The plot has honestly reproduced the data for Apple stock price.

## Recommendation

I have two recommendations on this plot. First of all, as mentioned in the caption, Pranay may intend to address the stock price of Apple around 2008. Therefore, it's better to take a closer before and after 2008, for example, to look at the stock price of each month during 2006-2009. Secondly, it will be more insightful if Pranay can combine the stock price of Apple with major stock indexes like Nasdaq.
