## Clarity

The plot is clear and easy to read, and the quantities being visualized are shown explicitly. Maximum, minimum, first and third quartiles, median and outliers of Citi bikers' trip duration for two age groups are shown in the plot. One problem would be Siddhanth does not include date of the data he used.

## Esthetic

The plot has reached the standard for aesthetics. It uses distinct colors to distinguish the distribution for two age groups. And the scale and label of x and y are chosen appropriately.

## Honesty

The plot has honestly reproduced the data from Citi bike.

## Recommendation

I have four recommendations on this plot. First of all, the plot does not have a title and a caption which are required for every plot and are important such that readers can better understand what Siddhanth wants to deliver. Secondly, the author can unify the font for x and y labels, for example, some letters are capitalized while others are not. Thirdly, the marker type and marker size for the outliers can be improved. Lastly, I'm not quite sure why Siddhanth uses 40 years old to divide the age group. Maybe we can have more age groups and take gender and days of week into consideration to gain more insight.
