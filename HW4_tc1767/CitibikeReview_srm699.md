I have inspected Tingyu's submission of the citibike assignment on whether customers are less likely to ride than subscribers.

a. The null hypothesis and the alernative hypothesis are the opposite of what they should actually be as the null hypothesis should be opposite to the idea behind the test while the alternative hypothesis should be similar to the idea but I think she has mixed up both these.
I think the null and alternative hypothesis could have been formulated better as currently, they compare the customers and subscribers only on weekdays but, the actual idea is to compare them throughout the week, including weekends.
